- Knowledge Base components:
    + Requirements documents
    + figma
    + Story board (ppt)

====> Test case scenarios

 - figma (widget captioning) and initial_prompt can be updated to produce more effective output

- Knowledge Base Summary:
  + Requirements:
    * Functional requirements
    * Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
    * Business rules and constraints
    * Edge cases and limitations
  
  + User Interface:
    * Widgets and components
    * Screen flows and navigation paths
    * Input validations
    * Error states and messages
    * Responsive behavior expectations
  
  + Functionalities:
    * Core business processes
    * API endpoints and integrations
    * Data transformations
    * Authentication and authorization rules
    * Background processes

=========> Need a function to normalize these Knowledges  

From Knowledge base summary, now we have to generate:
    - Test case story 
    - UI testing 
    - Functional testing
