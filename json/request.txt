# 4. Detailed Instructions & Scope (Apply to ALL UI/Visual Test Case Generation)

## Analyze Inputs
Meticulously parse all provided **User Stories, Requirements, UI Descriptions, and Storyboards**. Extract every explicit and implicit UI/Visual detail. Map test cases back to specific stories/requirements using relevant references.   

## Generate Test Cases Covering:

### A. Visual Verification (Reference Design Specifications if provided)
- **Layout/Composition:** Verify element alignment, spacing (padding/margins), positioning relative to container and other elements. Check grid adherence.   
- **Typography:** Verify font family, size, weight, style, line height, and color for all text elements (headers, body, labels, links, placeholders, etc.).   
- **Color Palette:** Verify exact color codes (e.g., HEX, RGBA) for backgrounds, text, borders, icons, states (hover, focus, active, disabled), and feedback elements.   
- **Imagery/Iconography:** Verify correct assets, aspect ratio, resolution, clarity, and consistent icon style. Ensure appropriate alt text exists for accessibility (visual check of attribute presence).   
- **Visual Consistency:** Ensure styling of common elements (buttons, inputs, cards, modals) is uniform across the feature/application according to designs/style guides.   
- **Field Count/Presence:** Verify the correct number and presence of expected UI elements (fields, buttons, columns, text blocks, images) based on UI descriptions/designs.   

### B. Interaction & UI Visual Feedback
- **Element Interactivity Appearance:** Test all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, checkboxes, radios, dropdowns, toggles, sliders, pickers, etc.). Ensure they appear operable (e.g., not visually broken, have expected pointer) and show appropriate visual feedback upon interaction.   
- **Visual State Changes:** Verify all specified visual states for interactive elements are displayed correctly:
  - Default appearance   
  - Hover appearance (e.g., color change, underline)   
  - Focus appearance (e.g., outline visible)   
  - Active/Pressed appearance   
  - Disabled appearance (e.g., greyed out, non-interactive pointer)   
  - Selected appearance (for checkboxes, radios, etc.)   
- **Visual Feedback Mechanisms:** Verify the presence, visibility, and correct appearance of:
  - Loading indicators (spinners, skeletons are displayed when expected)   
  - Success/error/warning/info messages (verify they appear, have correct styling/color, and content rendering. Do not test the logic triggering them.)   
  - Inline validation feedback (verify error/success styles appear on fields, e.g., red border. Do not test validation logic.)   
- **Navigation Element Appearance:** Verify visual aspects of navigation elements (menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, back buttons, links) - are they present, styled correctly, and show expected hover/active states?   
- **Forms Appearance:** Verify:
  - Input fields render correctly with expected visual attributes (placeholders visible, correct type visually implied e.g., password dots).   
  - Display of error messages (correct styling, positioning) when validation criteria (per UI spec) are not met. Do not test the validation logic itself.   
  - Visual feedback on submission (e.g., button enters loading state, confirmation message appears). Do not test if data was actually submitted.   
- **Mobile Gesture Visual Feedback:** Verify UI responds visually as expected to standard gestures where specified (e.g., element highlights on tap, visual feedback during swipe).   
- **Transitions/Animations:** Verify visual smoothness, performance (no jank), and non-disruptiveness of UI animations.   

### C. Usability (Visual & Layout Aspects)
- **Visual Clarity & Intuitiveness:** Test whether controls, labels, and information hierarchy are visually clear and arranged logically according to the design.   
- **Visual Efficiency:** Assess if the layout allows users to visually locate primary elements easily.   
- **Error Message Presentation:** Verify that error messages, when displayed, are visually prominent, clearly associated with the cause, and legibly styled. Do not test the functional accuracy or guidance content.   
- **Task Flow Visuals:** Verify the visual continuity and layout consistency across steps in a multi-step process as defined in storyboards/designs.   

### D. Responsiveness & Adaptability (Visual Layout Changes)
- Generate specific test cases for defined breakpoints/viewports (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).   
- If not defined, use standard ones:  
  - `<768px` (Mobile)  
  - `768px-1024px` (Tablet)  
  - `>1024px` (Desktop)   
- Verify layout adjustments (reflow, element resizing/hiding/stacking), navigation visual changes (e.g., burger menu appears), and image scaling/cropping across viewports. Focus strictly on the visual rendering.   
- Include tests for visual layout in **portrait and landscape orientations** on mobile/tablet where applicable.   

### E. Accessibility (Visual & UI Structure Aspects)
- **Keyboard Navigation Focus Indicator:** Verify all interactive elements receive a visible focus indicator when navigated to via keyboard. Verify the focus order appears logical based on visual layout.   
- **Screen Reader Related UI Checks:**
  - Verify meaningful images have an `alt` attribute present in the HTML (visual inspection or dev tools). Do not test screen reader output.   
  - Verify form controls have associated `<label>` tags or `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` attributes present. Do not test screen reader output.   
- **Color Contrast:** Ensure text/background and UI component/state contrast ratios appear to meet minimums based on design specifications or standard guidelines (e.g., 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text/graphics).   
- **Text Resizing:** Verify UI layout remains usable and text readable (no major overlaps or content cut-offs) when browser base text size is increased to 200%.   
- **Target Size:** Verify clickable/tappable elements appear to meet minimum size/spacing requirements per design specs or guidelines (visual estimation).

# 5. Test Case Design Principles & Rules

## Granularity
- Each test case should have a **single, clear UI/Visual objective**.  
- Steps must be **atomic** (one action/observation per step).   

## Completeness
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all UI/Visual aspects mentioned in the provided inputs.   

## Scenarios
Generate tests for:
- **Positive Scenarios:** Verifying standard appearance and visual feedback.   
- **Negative Scenarios (UI/Visual):** Verifying error states are displayed correctly (e.g., error message styling, field borders), elements appear correctly when disabled.   
- **Edge Cases (UI/Visual):** Verifying visual layout with empty states, how UI renders with unusually long text or large images, visual appearance of disabled states, visual representation of zero results.   

## ID Format
- Strictly follow `[AP-PX-NNN]`, starting `NNN` at `001` for phase `P1` (UI Testing) and incrementing sequentially.   

## Avoid Redundancy
- Consolidate test cases verifying the **exact same visual element/style/behavior** across different user flows unless context significantly changes appearance.   

## Determine Automation Potential (automatable field)
- **Yes:** If the test case relies on verifiable UI element properties (CSS, position, attributes), visual regression testing tools can be used, predictable visual states.   
- **No:** If the test relies heavily on subjective aesthetic assessment (subtle layout nuances, animation smoothness) requiring human eyes.   
- **Partial:** If some steps involve checking specific visual properties (automatable) but others require subjective human judgment (manual).   

## EXPLICIT EXCLUSION
DO NOT generate tests that:
- Verify data is saved correctly to a database.
- Check API responses.
- Validate business logic calculations.
- Confirm functional outcomes of user actions.
- Test performance beyond visual rendering.
